Donation Campaign

⚪ Search Button Functionality: We have added a search button to our project, allowing users to search for necessary donation categories. When a category is entered in the search bar, clicking the search button will display only the donations in the specified category on the homepage.

⚪ GitHub Commits: We have added optimal GitHub commits to track the progress of our project, including changes made to our code.

⚪ Responsive Design: We have designed our website to be responsive on all devices (desktop, mobile, and tablet) to ensure that users can have a seamless experience while exploring the site.
